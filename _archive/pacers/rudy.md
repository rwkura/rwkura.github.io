Short/Long Course - 5:00-6:00/km

Preferred pace - anywhere from 5:00 to 6:00 depending on how the body feels on the night.

Favourite SHR Course: Lavender Bay in the summertime.

Rudy's running adventure began as a once-a-year runner after friends convinced him to do the city2surf in 2011 and he decided he would continue to do the event each year as a tradition.

Running became an increasing part of Rudy's life when he relocated to the US for work in 2015, and his employer placed him in an apartment next to a running trail and gave him more free time than he knew what to do with 

Shortly after returning to Sydney, running became a full-blown hobby after joining a running group and realising the benefits of running in a social setting and developing a consistent routine / reason to leave the office each day, which Rudy has maintained through joining the pacing group at SHR!
