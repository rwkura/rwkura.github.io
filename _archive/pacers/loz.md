Long Course - 5:00/km

Loz started running with SHR early this year in 2023 and soon after became a pacer for the 5 minute long course! 

Loz started running in 2020 (covid lockdown activity) in Tasmania becoming a regular at the local Park Run. Moving to Sydney early 2022, Loz’s passion for running was ignited! 
Loz enjoys long distances races - this year racing in the Sydney 10km and City2Surf  events as well as the Hoka Runaway, Gold Coast and Nike Melbourne half marathon events. Her goal for 2023 was to run her first marathon in which she achieved at the Sydney Marathon event.

SHR keeps you accountable and motivated to achieve your goals with the continuous support and encouragement from the team. 

Goals pending for next years running season! 2024 let’s go!
