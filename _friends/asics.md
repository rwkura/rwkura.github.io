The story of ASICS began with a simple belief: a run is more than a workout or a competition. Sports are more than a game, and they have the potential to improve your mental health.

“Sound Mind, Sound Body™” is the belief that people get happier when they push themselves. The phrase is ASICS’ guiding philosophy.

ASICS is an acronym for the Latin expression “Anima Sana In Corpore Sano” by ancient Roman satirist Juvenal. This means "A Sound Mind in a Sound Body."
