Long Course - 5:00-5:30/km

Distance Preference: Long Course (10-15km).

Favourite SHR Course: Rushcutters Bay! (Lavender Bay is a close 2nd)

Adam is our team leader and has been running with SHR since 2013, the same year that he ran his first marathon. He usually runs the group warmup session at the start of our runs, and also works part-time as a personal trainer and running coach, with a passion for helping runners to prevent injuries. 

Adam enjoys Ultra Trail races, and has participated in several long-distance running events both in Australia and overseas. He is also enthusiastic about Orienteering and Rogaining, despite having a terrible sense of direction! Ask him about upcoming events on the race calendar and training trips to prepare for your next distance goal.
