Meet Emme

Emme properly started running (aka downloaded Strava) during the lockdown in 2020. Being from the UK, running conditions are never as reliable as Sydney, so she has experienced running in snow and showers. 

Emme moved to Sydney at the start of 2023 and started SHR soon after. She loves coming to the club and pacing groups. Itâ€™s really helped with her speed and stamina - chatting all the way around the course. 

She did plan on doing the marathon, but injury saved her from the heat. A marathon debut is set for next year though, and maybe she'll finally get a smart watch to assist with the training ;)
