Long Course - 5:00-5:30/km

Ianâ€™s running journey started like most of people, at parkrun. He started running further and signed up for Ultra Trail Australia - 50. Knowing he needed to train smarter and more consistently, he attended his first SHR in 2019. 

He was a regular member of the 5:30 pace group, regularly doing the long & bonus distance group. He stepped into a pacing role throughout the pandemic, pacing the 5 or 5:30 long distance group.

When not at SHR, you can see him training in the city during the week & in the mountains over the weekend for his next trail race.
