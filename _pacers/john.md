Short/Long Course - 5:00/km

Distance Preference: Usually short course but happy to step up to the long when required

Favourite SHR Course: Probably the little used KX/Loftus Road course just for the uphill challenge

Originally from a small town outside Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England, John only took up running in his mid-30s once he had realised it was possible to run in Sydney without freezing to death or his hair blowing off.

He has been running on and off with SHR for 6-7 years (when injuries permit) but only started pacing (usually the 5 minute short) during the pandemic.

He took up running mainly to get fit as the middle-aged spread started to take hold, but values the unexpected social friendly aspect of the running community and the mental health benefits running brings.

He has completed in several half mararthons and multiple City2Surfs but only one marathon so far..and definitely no ultras!
