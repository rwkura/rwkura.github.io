Nick is from the UK and also spent 11 years in Germany before coming to Sydney in January 2023. One of the first things Nick did when he arrived was join SHR as he was seeking some 'non-work adult human contact' while waiting for his family to arrive in Sydney. He immediately fell in love with the community and has been a dedicated regular ever since. 

A firm believer in the club's spirit, Nick is always the first to embrace a theme and dress up for the occasion. He officially joined the pacing team in June 2025 and is proud to guide the 5:30 group. 

His favourite courses are Lavender Bay in the Spring and Rushcutters Bay anytime.
