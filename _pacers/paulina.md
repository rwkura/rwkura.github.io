Long Course - 5:00/km - Fast Five :)

Favourite course: Ms Mac Chair

Paulina is a polish/canadian gal who came to Sydney in 2016 and that’s when she joined SHR. Since then, this club went from running with people who love to run (and drink) into a running family. In 2017 she became a pacer, pacing her group that most people know as the “fast five” group. :) Her passion for running and fitness started at the age of 16 and led her towards her career as a physio and a running coach. You can find her running races on the roads, or jumping into the trails for a run on the weekends with friends. 

Other than running she also loves to go camping with her husband to be and her 2 dogs, Roy and Yogi Bear. Recently she became a new mum to a beautiful baby boy and she's currently on pacing maternity leave. Paulina's goal as a pacer is to reach out to as many people as she can, showing them how amazing the sport of running is with friends and the potential we have to grow as runners.

"This club means the world to me and the friends I have made here have touched my life in so many ways."
