Short Course - 6:00/km

Favourite SHR Course: Anything over the Harbour Bridge!

Ray started running during one of the many Sydney lockdowns in 2021, and he has been hooked ever since! On weekends, you'll find him at St Peters parkrun complaining about the big hill and finding excuses to have coffee after the run.

Ray recently finished the 2023 Sydney marathon and is already looking forward to next year's one where hopefully the weather won't be sweltering!
