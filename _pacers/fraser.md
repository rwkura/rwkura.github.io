Long Course - 5:30/km

Fraser has been running in Sydney since 2009, but didn't join SHR until 2021, when his long-term Achilles injury began to heal and he started working in the city.

Growing up in Wellington, New Zealand, he's used to trail runs, but has moved to the road in recent years, running the marathon in Sydney last year and in Gold Coast this year.

He normally paces the 5:30 long course, even if that means running the last part on his own while everyone else heads to the bar early.
