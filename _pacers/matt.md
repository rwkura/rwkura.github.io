Short Course - 6:00/km

Favourite course: Pyrmont

Matt started running 2016 as a cheaper way to keep fit than an expensive gym membership. The addictive nature of running has lead to Matt completing multiple full and half marathons.

Although injuries (and poor lifestyle choices) has decreased pace and distances covered, Matt still loves the social aspect of SHR and has been running with the group since 2018.

Outside of running Matt is a big sports fan, so hit him up for a conversation about your sport of choice.
