Meet Peter

Pace: 4:30, 4:40

Distance preference: Long course (10-13km)

Favourite SHR course: Harbour Bridge4
Peter started running in high school, and did his first City 2 Surf in 1992. He took a break for mountain biking, but after a memorable bike crash at Manly Dam took up running again at ParkRun in 2015 (only another 74 runs needed for the 250 shirt!). He joined Sydney Harbour Runners in about 2018, and became a pacer in 2023. When not running he can be found road biking in the Eastern Suburbs or the Northern Beaches, or planning an overnight hike.

His favourite things about Sydney Harbour Runners are the challenge and exhilaration of running a brisk pace with a friendly group, making good friendships, and welcoming and encouraging new members.
