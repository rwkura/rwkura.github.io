Long Course - 5:30-6:30/km

I love swimming and cycling, growing up. Several years ago, my work got me into triathlon. Whilst I did okay with my swims and cycles, I always struggled with my runs. I guess I just never enjoyed it as much as the other two sports.

Then came 2023, and I decided that my New Year's resolution was to get better at running. The goal was really just to run better, so I could enjoy the sport of triathlon and not feel like dying when the running leg comes. So I joined SHR in the first week of 2023. Since then, I have become a far better runner than I ever thought I would, and I now enjoy running way more than I used to.

I have also met so many amazing people through SHR, and a few have become my close friends. To top it all off, SHR also helped me breaking my own 5km, 10km, and half marathon PBs. I also did a marathon, something I never would have thought about before I joined SHR.

If there's anything I've learned, I don't swim/ride/run for a fast time, I just do them to have a great time.
